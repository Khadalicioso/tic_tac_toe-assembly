# tic_tac_toe-assembly Explanation

# Data Segment:

• new_line: Contains the ASCII codes for a newline character (carriage return and line feed).
• game_draw: Defines the initial state of the game board as a string.
• game_pointer: Stores the memory addresses of the individual game board cells.
• win_flag: Indicates whether a player has won.
• player: Contains the current player's identifier ("0" or "1").
• game_over_message: Displays the message when the game ends.
• game_start_message: Displays the message at the beginning of the game.
• player_message: Contains the message indicating the current player.
• win_message: Contains the message indicating a win.
• type_message: Prompts the player to enter their move.

# Code Segment:

## Initialization:

• Sets up the segment registers.
• Calls set_game_pointer to initialize the game_pointer array with the memory addresses of the game board cells.

##Main Loop:

• Clears the screen.
• Displays the game start message.
• Displays the current player.
• Displays the game board.
• Prompts the player to enter their move.
• Reads the keyboard input.
• Calculates the corresponding index in the game_pointer array.
• Updates the game board with the player's move using update_draw.
• Checks if the game has ended using check.
• If the game has ended, jumps to the game_over label.
• Changes the current player using change_player.
• Continues the main loop.

## change_player:

• Toggles the value in the player variable to switch between players.

## update_draw:

• Gets the memory address from the game_pointer array.
• Determines the character to draw based on the current player.
• Updates the game board cell with the appropriate character.

## check:

• Calls check_line, check_column, and check_diagonal to check for a win.

## check_line, check_column, and check_diagonal:

• Iterate through the rows, columns, and diagonals, respectively.
• Check if all cells in the line, column, or diagonal contain the same character.
• If so, set the win_flag to 1.

## game_over:

• Clears the screen.
• Displays the game start message.
• Displays the game board.
• Displays the game over message.
• Displays the winning player.

## set_game_pointer:

• Initializes the game_pointer array with the memory addresses of the game board cells.

## print:

• Prints the content of the dx register.

## clear_screen:

• Clears the screen.

## read_keyboard:

• Reads a key from the keyboard and returns it in the ah register.

# Key Points:

• The game uses a simple 3x3 grid represented by the game_draw string.
• The game_pointer array stores the memory addresses of the individual game board cells, making it easier to update the board.
• The check_line, check_column, and check_diagonal functions check for winning conditions by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.
• The change_player function switches between players.
• The update_draw function updates the game board with the player's move.
• The print and clear_screen functions handle output and screen clearing.
• The read_keyboard function reads input from the keyboard.
